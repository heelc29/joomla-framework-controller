## Interfaces

### `Controller\ControllerInterface`

`Controller\ControllerInterface` is an interface that requires a class to be implemented with the following methods:

- `execute`
- `getApplication`
- `getInput`
- `setApplication`
- `setInput`

## Classes

### `Controller\AbstractController`

#### Construction

The constructor for `Controller\AbstractController` takes an optional `Joomla\Input\Input` object and an optional `Joomla\Application\AbstractApplication` object. One or the other can be omitted but using `getApplication` or `getInput` without setting them will throw an exception.

#### Usage

The `Controller\AbstractController` class is abstract so cannot be used directly. The derived class must implement the execute method to satisfy the interface requirements. Note that the execute method no longer takes a "task" argument as each controller class. Multi-task controllers are still possible by overriding the execute method in derived classes. Each controller class should do just one sort of 'thing', such as saving, deleting, checking in, checking out and so on. However, controllers, or even models and views, have the liberty of invoking other controllers to allow for HMVC architectures.

```php
namespace Examples;

use Joomla\Application;
use Joomla\Input;

/**
 * My custom controller.
 *
 * @since  1.0
 */
class MyController extends Controller\Base
{
	/**
	 * Executes the controller.
	 *
	 * @return  void
	 *
	 * @since   1.0
	 * @throws  \RuntimeException
	 */
	public function execute()
	{
		echo time();
	}
}

// We'll assume we've already defined an application in this namespace.
$app = new ExampleApplication;
$input = new Input\Input;

// Instantiate the controller.
$controller = new MyController($input, $app);

// Print the time.
$controller->execute();
```

#### Serialization

The `Controller\AbstractController` class implements `Serializable`. When serializing, only the input property is serialized. When unserializing, the input variable is unserialized and the internal application property is loaded at runtime.


## Installation via Composer

Add `"joomla/controller": "~2.0"` to the require block in your composer.json and then run `composer install`.

```json
{
	"require": {
		"joomla/controller": "~2.0"
	}
}
```

Alternatively, you can simply run the following from the command line:

```sh
composer require joomla/controller "~2.0"
```

If you want to include the test sources, use

```sh
composer require --prefer-source joomla/controller "~2.0"
```
